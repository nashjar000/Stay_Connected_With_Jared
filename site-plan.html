      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wanted a simpler social media platform to stay in touch with your friends? With my website, you can do just that. It’s similar to any other social media platform but simpler. Anyone with an account can feel free to comment on posts, photos, or videos that I upload to the website which allows for an easy way to know what we’ve all been up to. It’s a simpler version of social media!

      <h3>About the Site</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to Stay Connected with Jared to stay connected with me. My friends and family can have an easy way to see and know what I’ve been up to. They can have fun viewing photos, videos, and stories in one location. 

        There is no needed information to complete any actions that my site requires. If I decide to add more things to it, later on, they may need their email or phone number in order to comment on posts. But, for now, there is no needed Information users need.

        People who visit my site would want to come to this site instead of other sites because they will have access to viewing what I’ve been up to in one place instead of needing to view multiple places such as Facebook, Instagram, or other social media accounts.
