            <p>Our Christmas tree from this year--my first ever LIVE TREE.
                Previous years my family used our plastic tree because we didn't
                want the real trees to shed the pine needles all over the place.
                Ironically, however, the real tree shed less than the fake tree, lol.

            <p> Jarom, Rachel, Joel, and Marian decided to do Christmas in July since none of us would be around for
                Christmas. We made spaghetti from the movie Elf and watched It's a Wonderful Life. It was really fun! :)
